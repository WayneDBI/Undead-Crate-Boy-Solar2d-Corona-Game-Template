Based on the famous Super Crate Box App. This template gives you the basis to build a fully immersive and compelling game. Shoot the baddies, jump around the screen and collect the crates. It’s fun, manic and really addictive. Multiple enemies, and different actions help make this game more immersive, but add some more levels and watch the sales in the App Store coming flying in…. Crates fall in random places – and have a randomly assigned weapon power-up.

This template includes 2 levels, from which you can easily expand into many more levels.
